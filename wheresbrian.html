Imagine finding your dream Loire Valley stone house—vineyards endless, excitement soaring... until Notaire contracts, diagnostics, and rapid-French negotiations turn joy into overwhelm.<br><br>

Or selling a long-owned property: Market pricing, surveys, energy certificates, elusive buyers—all exhausting from abroad.<br><br>

Perhaps renovating: Securing permits, sourcing trustworthy artisans, meeting strict regulations, overseeing works while preserving your home's charm.<br><br>

Then the unexpected: An urgent administrative letter you can't decipher; a critical medical appointment needing clear communication; or arranging care for elderly loved ones—understanding France's system, finding reliable home help tailored to their wishes.<br><br>

I've stood beside clients through every challenge, turning worry into relief. As your discreet <strong>France's butler</strong>, I handle it all with grace and confidentiality:<br><br>

• <strong>Property Buying & Selling</strong>: Full guidance—viewings, Notaire meetings, contracts, market insights, negotiations, seamless completion.<br>
• <strong>Building & Renovation</strong>: Permits, architect liaison, artisan sourcing, project oversight, regulatory compliance.<br>
• <strong>Urgent Assistance</strong>: Deciphering critical documents, accompanying medical appointments, liaising for clarity.<br>
• <strong>Caring for Loved Ones</strong>: Navigating French care options, securing trusted home help or residential solutions.<br>
• <strong>Everyday Concierge</strong>: Appointments, reservations, rare sourcing, admin tasks, translations, personal support.<br><br>

From dream purchase to serene retirement, I quietly make France feel like home—stress-free.<br><br>

Say bonjour—let me take care of the rest.
