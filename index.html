I was shooting a film in Paris and needed a specific art piece. Brian was able to connect me with a Paris-based painter featured in La Galerie C√©cile Dufay and complete my request. Everything went smoothly, and we were delighted with the final product. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAqObyqOZrm/?img_index=1">üé¨</a>
