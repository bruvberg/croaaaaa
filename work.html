            <p><code>It’s impolite to talk too much about oneself — so excuse the French arrogance.

But to give you an idea of what I do: my work as a translator quickly became more than just words. I began acting as a bridge, helping clients connect with French <i>savoir-faire </i>and <i>savoir-vivre.</i></code>
<br><br> ---<br>
<br>Living near Paris led me into unique, sometimes unexpected projects. I was asked to help trace missing gold at the Banque de France, tied to the RMS Republic treasure, working directly with Captain Martin Bayerle. <br> <br>🏴‍☠️<img src="https://scontent-cdg4-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/416611285_1389270048352517_7189782427710066349_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s720x720_tt6&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6IkNBUk9VU0VMX0lURU0uaW1hZ2VfdXJsZ2VuLjExODd4MTE0My5zZHIuZjI5MzUwLmRlZmF1bHRfaW1hZ2UifQ&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg4-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QEUo-D2w7VmWRDJyv_gikT-1EznHqJvstrjrfVuOnWXPqjDuCTbO07AXbd7ImRnTzY&_nc_ohc=HOCqGPx7DnMQ7kNvwHVo7nw&_nc_gid=K9mQcQBGsN5P9KR36e8NjA&edm=AP4sbd4BAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzI3MjMxNjIzMjE2MTQ3ODcwOQ%3D%3D.3-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfRDUBemqFgMR5kLgwhoOx7xjIpfl7vag5I0F0yhv7p4lg&oe=686ED7B9&_nc_sid=7a9f4b" style="padding: 30px;"> Soon after, I was deep in the archives of the Bibliothèque Richelieu, assisting a New York researcher searching for forgotten French texts. Then came the arts. A filmmaker needed a painter in Paris — I found the perfect one.

Around that time, I just wanted a Hugh Grant haircut from <i>Love Actually</i>. But life had other plans: I became a different kind of Hugh — the personal agent of a Playmate model during Paris Fashion Week.   <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAqObyqOZrm/?img_index=1">📽️</a></td><br> <video src="-3426824653944414274.mov"  width="100%" autoplay muted loop controls style="padding:30px" ></video>
<br>
In between, I’ve managed private homes, supported legal matters for foreign clients, and acted as a discreet liaison. One case involved assisting a man from Ottawa who believed he was facing language discrimination — I helped him defend his right to speak French.
<br>
Each assignment is different — translation, research, cultural scouting, personal support — but the goal is always the same: to bring you more of France.
