I’m a native Frenchman who started as a translator—but Paris changed everything.
English-speaking clients didn’t just want words translated; they needed someone to navigate the real France: the bureaucracy, the hidden gems, the impossible requests. <br><br>
So I stepped in—discreet, bilingual, always one step ahead—like the butler you wish you had.<br><br>
I’ve guided treasure hunter Captain Martin Bayerle through the Banque de France archives chasing clues to the RMS Republic’s lost gold. Hunted down a rare painting across Paris for filmmaker Alec Huggins mid-shoot. Helped a Canadian fight for his linguistic rights. Even served as personal agent for a Playmate cutting through the chaos of Fashion Week.<br><br>
These aren’t stories—they’re proof.<br><br>
Now, from the serene elegance of Les Hauts de Loire in the Loire Valley, I offer that same unflappable expertise to you.<br><br>
Property hunts, red-tape battles, exclusive bookings, emergencies—whatever France throws at you, I handle it with grace and total confidentiality.<br><br>
