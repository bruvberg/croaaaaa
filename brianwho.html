As a native Frenchman and trained translator, I began assisting researchers—until proximity to Paris revealed clients needed more: desires turned into reality, not just words.<br><br>

Translations evolved into discreet liaison work—like a trusted butler, guiding English-speakers through French savoir-faire and savoir-vivre with elegance and confidentiality.<br><br>

Paris brought memorable adventures: Assisting Captain Martin Bayerle with inquiries into the legendary RMS Republic treasure at the Banque de France; sourcing a rare painting for filmmaker Alec Huggins on a Paris shoot; supporting a Canadian in defending linguistic rights; acting as personal agent for a Playmate navigating Paris Fashion Week shows; and countless other resourceful tasks demanding discretion and ingenuity.<br><br>

Now settled as housekeeper at exquisite Les Hauts de Loire in the Loire Valley, I dedicate my bilingual expertise to fulfilling English-speaking clients' every whim with grace.<br><br>

Thus was born <strong>France's butler</strong>: Tailor-made, confidential support for property, administration, concierge, emergencies—and all aspects of life in France.
